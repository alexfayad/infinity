# Infinity Supply
Infinity supply was built to change the way discount shopping is done online. Instead of finding discounted products individually when given the prompt by retailers, we wanted to conglomerate the discounts being offered by a variety of fashion retailers and make it all available on one platform. In this platform we would be able to filter by the types of products and the greatest discounts.
